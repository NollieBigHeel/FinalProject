# FinalProject

### Why am I doing this project?
I am doing this project as it is the final project from my course at QA.

### How I excpected the challenge to go?
I expected the challeng to go better with less problems,but have managed to overcome most issues in the end.

### What went well/ Didn't go as planned?
**What went well:**
 * Creating my pokedex object and connecting mySQL database.
 * Making sure I orginized my priorties.
 * Creating an Agile board on Jira.
 * Making sure I pushed my code to the right branch!

**Didn't go as plan:**
 * Had issues connecting to H2 database.
 * Testing my GET requests.

### Possible improvements
* I need more practice on testing.
* I need to revise on what some of the commands mean/are doing.
